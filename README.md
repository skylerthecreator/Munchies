Prompt: Consumer tech solutions to helping minority groups (race, gender, income)

Our project: a recipe sharing website specifically created to help people of different ethnicities find recipes shared by people of the same background.

Description: Our team had very little experience with Django prior to this project. One of our primary goals was to learn the essence of the software and use it to develop our website. We also needed to utilize HTML, CSS, and Python to bring our project to life. In the end, we are happy with what we learned and created with such little time, and of course very proud of our 1st place finish!
